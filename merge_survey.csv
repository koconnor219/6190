I wasn't sure if I would be able to write a satisfactory summary, but I feel that I got better with every lesson. Before this tutorial, if I was asked whether I could write good summaries in English, my response would have been Strongly disagree. After finishing the tutorial, I somewhat agree with it now. And believe me, that's no mean feat considering that I had no knowledge beforehand in this field. Christina and Jordan also play a crucial role in this tutorial. The way they guide us deserves special appreciation. Teaching us how to identify and use the signal words to write a good summary was just another job well accomplished by this system.","One reason is that at times, the system kept asking me to write the summary in my own words. Besides I was already using my own words as far as possible. I wasn't copy-pasting it from the given text. I'd have preferred to have hints as to what parts I was required to change. It was quite confusing when prompted to write the summary using my own words. Now, exclusively for those cases, I don't know how I could have provided a good summary using different words unless I was to change the context of the text provided. /  / Secondly, I feel that the system should have asked about one's fluency in English and provided the text to summarize taking into consideration one's fluency. /  / Well, that's about it. Hope it won't affect my HIT verification process.",0 days 00:39:00,Both,Asian,1,Bachelor
